toolkit
=======

A collection of links, file resources and git submodules representing the tools I have used, use now, or want to use in the future.

Please feel free to explore, and feel free to:

* **Star** this repository to keep track of the tools I use, or:
* **Fork** your own copy of this repository to keep track of the tools YOU use.

I'd also appreciate a Tweet, Email, Message, whatever, if you like this concept and want to share it around :-)
