toolkit
=======

A collection of links, file resources and git submodules representing the tools I have used, use now, or want to use in the future.

I keep this in Git because:

1. I can easily add to it from anywhere
2. I can see when I added things, or change things with commits that note WHY I changed
3. Submodules mean that I have copies of these repositories that I can reference when I'm offline.
4. Github kindly provides a nice interface for me and others to view my toolkit.

This project widely uses [Git submodules](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules), which require some set up the first time you clone this repository. To check out all the submodules, run these commands after cloning:

* `git submodule init`
* `git submodule update` (this may take some time!)

These steps are necessary because submodules are just like 'soft links' to other repositories - while they are downloaded for each copy of the repository, they are not uploaded to the remote repository.

Please feel free to explore, and feel free to:

* **Star** this repository to keep track of the tools I use, or:
* **Fork** your own copy of this repository to keep track of the tools YOU use.

I'd also appreciate a Tweet, Email, Message, whatever, if you like this concept and want to share it around :-)
